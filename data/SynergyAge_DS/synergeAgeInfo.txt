Number of gene combinations: 1833

The SQL tables and the JSON file have the following information and structure:

Table (models): each row represents a cohort for a mutant (or for wild type)

Table fields:

id - an unique ID for the mutant
tax_id - NCBI taxon ID
name - mutant name
genes - the genes that were genetically modulated
temp - the temperature at which the experiment was carried out
lifespan - the mean lifespan of the cohort
pmid - PubMed ID of the paper describing the results
effect - the percentage by which lifespan was increased, compared to the wild type in the same experiment, where available
details - a short description of the methodology used in the paper
diet - the diet under which animals were kept
interaction_type - the type of epistasis interaction, automatically catalogued based on the definitions/methods described in Bunu et al., 2020
strain - [for Drosophila melanogaster only] the strain name for the n-mutant, as it appears in the referenced paper
Table (model_interactions): each row represents a SynergyAge transition from an n-mutant to the corresponding (n+1)-mutant

Table fields:

id1 - id of the n-mutant (or wild type)
id2 - id of the (n+1)-mutant
phenotype_comparison - lifespan comparison between the phenotype of (n+1)-mutant and n-mutant

In the CSV file, each row represents a comparison between wild type (where available), n-mutant, 1-mutant (where available) and (n+1)-mutant, with all the gene-centric information included within the row.
